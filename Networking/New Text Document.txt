To solve this problem, we first need to determine the values of 'x' and 'y' from your student ID (1082759):

Student ID: 1082759
Third digit: 8 (from the third position in the ID)
Fifth digit: 7 (from the fifth position in the ID)

Given network block: 200.x.y.0/30
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.252 (30 bits for the network portion)

a) Number of networks:
Since the subnet mask is /30, which provides 2 usable IP addresses per subnet (2^2 - 2), the total number of networks is 2^8 (since 'x' can range from 0 to 255) * 2^8 (since 'y' can range from 0 to 255) = 65,536 networks.

b) Number of hosts per network:
With a /30 subnet mask, there are 2 usable IP addresses per subnet (2^2 - 2), so there are 2 hosts per network.

c) Network address, First host IP, Last host IP, and Broadcast address for each of the first three subnetworks:

Subnet 1:

Network address: 200.8.7.0
First host IP: 200.8.7.1
Last host IP: 200.8.7.2
Broadcast address: 200.8.7.3
Subnet 2:

Network address: 200.8.7.4
First host IP: 200.8.7.5
Last host IP: 200.8.7.6
Broadcast address: 200.8.7.7
Subnet 3:

Network address: 200.8.7.8
First host IP: 200.8.7.9
Last host IP: 200.8.7.10
Broadcast address: 200.8.7.11
Please note that these calculations are based on the assumption that 'x' and 'y' can take any value from 0 to 255. If there are specific limitations or ranges for 'x' and 'y', the calculations would need to be adjusted accordingly.
